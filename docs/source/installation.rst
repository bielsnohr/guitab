============
Installation
============

``guitab`` is written completely using standard library modules, so it is
unlikely to cause any dependency problems. To install on your system, issue the
usual ``pip`` command from your shell::

    $ pip install guitab

That's it! The ``guitab`` Command Line Interface (CLI) should now be in your
path, and you can check with::

    $ which guitab

If that does not yield a path to the ``guitab`` executable, then something went
wrong with installation. Check your ``$PATH`` variable.
