=======================

.. py:module:: guitab.guitab

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   An interacive command line program that speeds up the process of writing
   guitar tabs.

   The user enters chords/fingering count by count with the final
   result being written to a text file.

.. py:class:: GuitabShell(completekey='tab', stdin=None, stdout=None)

   Bases: :py:obj:`cmd.Cmd`

   
   A simple framework for writing line-oriented command interpreters.

   These are often useful for test harnesses, administrative tools, and
   prototypes that will later be wrapped in a more sophisticated interface.

   A Cmd instance or subclass instance is a line-oriented interpreter
   framework.  There is no good reason to instantiate Cmd itself; rather,
   it's useful as a superclass of an interpreter class you define yourself
   in order to inherit Cmd's methods and encapsulate action methods.

   .. py:method:: do_forward(self, arg)

      
      The number of counts to go forward in the tab:  FORWARD 10

      The default is to move forward 1 space if no input is given to the command.

   .. py:method:: do_backward(self, arg)

      
      The number of counts to go backward in the tab:  BACKWARD 10

      The default is to move back 1 space if no input is given to the command.

   .. py:method:: do_chord(self, arg)

      
      The chord (i.e. finger positions) to write to the current position in the tab:  CHORD x 3 2 0 1 0

      The input order of strings runs from high E to low E.

   .. py:method:: do_bye(self, arg)

      
      Stop editing tab and exit:  BYE

      The current tab is saved to a file if one has been previously specified by RECORD.

      Print the entirety of the tab: PRINT

   .. py:method:: onecmd(self, line: str) -> bool

      
      Interpret the argument as though it had been typed in response
      to the prompt.

      This may be overridden, but should not normally need to be;
      see the precmd() and postcmd() methods for useful execution hooks.
      The return value is a flag indicating whether interpretation of
      commands by the interpreter should stop.

   .. py:method:: precmd(self, line)

      
      Hook method executed just before the command line is
      interpreted, but after the input prompt is generated and issued.

.. py:function:: main()

   
   Main function for guitab module

   This initiates a REPL-like program that takes in user input to build the
   tablature using a `Tab` object
